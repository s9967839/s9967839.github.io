I would describe my overall experience working in a group for this assignment as one of my best group works. Despite of joining the group little late, 
the members welcomed me without any hesitation. There was full participation and engagement from all the team members. The best part was that our meetings 
and conversations were enjoyable, relaxed, and at the same time, very fruitful. Besides, the team members’ contributions were tremendous.. It was easier to 
understand the assignment task clearly as we discussed the requirements together. Giving and receiving feedback from the team members on our work gave me 
confidence and motivation to complete the task.
<br>
Although we had hour-long meetings, I think that the only thing that could have improved was to have more sessions as they were one of the exciting parts of the group project. 
Overall, our group ‘ Tech heads’ performed well by showing flexibility, openness, honesty, enthusiasm, and dedication and I must say that this experience has improved my collaboration, 
communication and team work skill.

Overall, the team was just fantastic. Everyone really worked well together. People made time for the meetings and they were very attentive and they did the work they said. 
It was surprising how comfortable everyone was after the first meeting where we had a good ice breaker and people were not scared to say where they felt insecure (with certian technologies etc). and this was great as we were able to focus on what needed to be done
and we could allocate tasks out well. 
The one thing i think that could be improved if were able to have more collaboration sessions where we did the work during the meetings instead of talking. That would have knocked out alot of the work quickly. 
The one thing I've learnt about groups is that when you work hard initially to build rapport and come together and share common stories (not work related) you manage to work better as a team becuase people feel more comfortable. This was deifnatley the way 
in our team and we had great dynamic. 
<br>
I dont think the Github activity reflects the effort at all. Becuase some of us didn't feel comfortable with github and with HTML, we shared the load and focused on working on peoples strengths. Some of the team were better and quicker at HTML and took the load and others worked offline 
and uploaded to google drive. This was great for our team.

The team worked amazingly together and everyone was so welcoming and understanding. The teamwork that was involved was absolutely outstanding and couldn’t have asked for a better group of people to do assignment 2 with. Everyone put their 100% in and that is what you want from a team. I always looked forward to our meetings because it was a chance for us to come together and discuss our roles within the assignment and then once we had completed that, we discussed other topics outside of the assignment from our personal lives.
I definitely think that we could have had more meetings, which could have been an improvement, only because every meeting that we had, we got to know more about each other and by the second meeting I felt comfortable enough to provide the feedback and marks that I received from assignment 1.
One thing that surprised me was how GitHub actually works. I have never used GitHub before this subject and now that I have an idea about it, it has really become a game changer for me. I think there was more effort put in away from GitHub.  
One thing that I have learnt from working in a group is to always express your strengths and weaknesses, because there will always be a task that will best suit you and that will help the rest of the team.
