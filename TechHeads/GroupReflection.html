I would describe my overall experience working in a group for this assignment as one of my best group works. Despite of joining the group little late, 
the members welcomed me without any hesitation. There was full participation and engagement from all the team members. The best part was that our meetings 
and conversations were enjoyable, relaxed, and at the same time, very fruitful. Besides, the team members’ contributions were tremendous.. It was easier to 
understand the assignment task clearly as we discussed the requirements together. Giving and receiving feedback from the team members on our work gave me 
confidence and motivation to complete the task.
<br>
Although we had hour-long meetings, I think that the only thing that could have improved was to have more sessions as they were one of the exciting parts of the group project. 
Overall, our group ‘ Tech heads’ performed well by showing flexibility, openness, honesty, enthusiasm, and dedication and I must say that this experience has improved my collaboration, 
communication and team work skill.

Towards the end of the assignment period, you should reflect as a group on how well you think you have performed in this assignment. You should include whatever evidence you may have about the groups processes (such as commit trails from GitHub, or project meeting minutes). Each member of the group should contribute up to 200 words about their own perception of the group, and the group as a whole should contribute around 400 words. This should include the following attributes.<br>
• What went well<br>
• What could be improved<br>
• At least one thing that was surprising<br>
• At least one thing that you have learned about groups<br>
• Remember to include in your section on Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on this assignment.
