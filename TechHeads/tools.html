<h2>Tools</h2>
<br>
<br>
The team collaborated well and used appropriate toosl to ensure the completion of the assignment. 
Given that the team members were geographically all seperated (each student has been located in a different state, with differing time zones), it was imperative that the use of Teams calendar for booking meetings
was utlised to ensure there were no muck ups in the time scheduling for meetings. 
This worked really well. 
The following tools were used for this assignment
<br>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Microsoft Teams </li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/s9967839/s9967839.github.io/tree/main/TechHeads">GitHub Repository</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Git Hub Desktop</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://rmiteduau-my.sharepoint.com/">Sharepoint</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Notepad ++</a></li>
</ul>
<br>

The team conducted several meetings, however only recorded 3 (plus the interview) as required in the assignment spec. The meeting recorded sessions along with attendence reports and links in sharepoint are below. 
We have also embedded the videos for ease of streaming within your browser. 
The team worked very well using the tools listed above and have been able to succesuflly complete all work throughout the tiem provided. 
<br>
<br>
<h4>Github Log</h4>
Github was used throughout the project. The team ran a session walking through how we would use Github, and ensured everyone knew how to manage the files on it. Some of of teh members were not overly confident, however they all did 
make commitments. Some users volunteered to do more of teh technical work, and others managed the content. This worked well as we played on teh strenghts of the team to reach an end goal. 
The Github logs are below. 
<br>
The following graph dispalys the contributions by  user. As can be seen, all users contributed however, some more than others. This does not represent effort on the assignment.

The following graph displays commits. As can be seen, there was a large number of commits when we designed the page, and more and more as the deadline approached!
