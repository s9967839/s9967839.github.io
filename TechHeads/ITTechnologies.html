<h3> Cloud, Servers & Services </h3>

<h4> What does it do? </h4>
<p> Cloud servers are a centralised server resource, that is retrieved by numerous users and on demand typically via the internet. They are hosted and distributed over a network, which contains the same traditional purposes of a physical server, which delivers storage, applications and processing power (“What is a Cloud Server? | VMware Glossary” 2021). Having the ability to access a server remotely and utilise its features with just a computer and an internet connection, really shows what technology is capable of and how far it has come. Recently, cloud computing has evolved into a new standard of attracting businesses to transfer to, as it disregards the need to plan ahead and allows users to begin from the bottom and once more services are demanded, the number of resources can be increased. However, there are issues that remain unanswered, despite the opportunities that have been created within the IT industry because of cloud computing (Zhang, Cheng & Boutaba 2010).
</p>

<p> Cloud computing can be utilised for a number of different tasks such as data analytics, storage, recovery and backup systems, testing and development, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, and Platform-as-a-Service. Cloud computing has opened up many paths to the future, and it will continue to do so with many other up and coming feature. What the future holds is anyone’s guess, but potential cloud features will most likely improve banking, healthcare, manufacturing, and even self-driving vehicles, along with improvement of diverse components such as cloud infrastructure, web applications, voice and text integration, machine learning and analytics, and many more special components (Sayegh 2021). It is only a matter of time until technology with this much power will be united into the world with the future of improvement.
</p>

<p> Virtualisation is a technology utilised to make cloud computing possible. In basic form, virtualisation helps to create a simulated, digital or virtual machine, that allows the cloud server to behave like a physical computer. This technology is so advanced, that it allows users to utilise the same cloud server, at the same time, and in different locations, without interacting or disrupting any data even though the users are on the same physical machine. Cloud computing makes everything a lot more efficient and economical when running multiple virtual machine at the same time, because then one server converts to several servers, and then one data centre, develops an entire army of data centres. This helps to serve many businesses at the same time, and at minimal costings (“What is the cloud? | Cloud definition” 2022).
</p>

<p> Cloud computing will continue to grow, and will be utilised by many organisations in the future. With technology growing at a fast rate, it is only a matter of time until new features of the cloud are unveiled. Technology continues to change and evolve the world that we live in today, and it is likely that we will see more technological advances that will only inspire cloud computing to become better in the near future.
</p>

<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
<p>Cloud computing has made life easy for many individuals, and for companies that are looking to save some money and become for efficient. This technology has made it easy for students to study and enrol online from anywhere in the world and at any time of the day. When an institution uses the cloud to store large amounts of data for easy access, it enables students to inexpensively access said data. Since the development of cloud computing, there have been many students in less developed countries, who have been able to access educational websites and commence studying online. Cloud computing has had a big impact on socialising, health, navigation, and shopping online. It has made life simple for those that haven’t been able to access these features physically (“Impacts Of Cloud Computing In Our Everyday Life” 2020).
</p>
<p>At present, there wouldn’t be much to change in regards to the positive impacts that have occurred around the world, however, as with anything in the modern world of technology, there will always be technical issues that impact companies or individuals negatively. Issues such as power or network outages, downtime, and even reboots. Events such as these can be critical to a company that solely relies on cloud based computing, as it can disable business processes, and could potentially damage the company (“Disadvantages of cloud computing | nibusinessinfo.co.uk” 2022).
</p>
<p>When moving to cloud computing, there are some likely changes that will occur, such as the process of product designing, closer relationships between departments and IT department, and better customer relations and interactions (“How Cloud Computing Is Changing Management” 2018). Depending on the department will depend on how much cloud computing will affect each individual. If a company decides to move to cloud computing, it is likely that they will no longer need the IT department, which means the IT employees would no longer be in a job. 
</p>

<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
<p>The change to cloud servers over the years has been more than beneficial to many people around the world. From being able to study online, work from home, utilise social media and online entertainment, and online shopping, it has made living much easier, especially with the pandemic that we are currently in.
</p>
<p>Given the current pandemic, it is good to know that a lot of companies are utilising cloud computing and storing data on the cloud because of the easy access for those that are having to work from home. In any case, most people can access their work documents right from their home office, which allows them to continue to be in the workforce and support themselves and their families.
</p>
<p>The way the world is currently, there will not be much change because we are so content with what we have in today’s modern society. Everything we use is connected to a server, from watching Netflix, playing video games, studying online, using our mobile phones and the downloadable applications, communicating with friends and family. Everything we do and use, is connected to the cloud in some way, most people just don’t know it. 
</p>
<p>While all the companies are moving to modern cloud computing, the older generation are slowly starting to evolve into the modern ways, though it is not as easy as we think. From using paper and facsimile machines, companies are now using electronic emails as their main method of communication, which for the older generation, may seem overwhelming at times. However, it is something that will become normal to the older generation as time goes on.
