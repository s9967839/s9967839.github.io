<b>What my test results mean to me </b><br><br>
The results of my test are that i am Consul and ESFJ-A type. I've completed some reading (I've done one of these befor in my career), and have gotten a versy similar score. Here are what it this means to me. 
I am observant and I am empathetic to people around me. I have good leadership skills as I am people focused and like being part of a wider community. I am very passionate about what I do and how I do it. 

In terms of my learning styles, I am mainly auditory. This is true as I have grown up watching youtube videos on how to do things, and when I hear about something and see it getting done, I can often replicate it.

In regards to my Personality trait scores, I agree with the results also, I am very agreeable and open. This has been my strength in my career and has helped. Being 0$ in Nerutocisim is very accurate also as I am rarley negative and have a very positive mindset. I do not like conflict. 
<br><br>
<b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b><br><br> 
I think its good to understand your personality and learning traits as this may affect how you are in a team. For my own results, I think that I am well suited towards team work and working in teams of poeple. As I have a very empathetic and agreeable side, I can 
understand and work around people and deal with difficult circumsastances well. My learning styles also show that I can and will learn via auditory means,which is well suited to team work. 
As I avoid conflict and know how to manage it, working in teams is ideal as there is always difficult people to deal with and I can manage the situations well. 
<br><br>
<b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b><br><br> 
I think the things that need to be taken into account when forming a team, for me, would be to focus around my assertive rating in the Myer Briggs test. I am heavily dominant in the Assertivness which means that I am quite relaxed and free from worry. This is ideal 
when dealing in stressfull situations and I have the ability to focus and navigate through issues. As I am also heavily dominant in the Extraverted rating, I have no issues with speaking or making people feel included. These are good traits for leadershiop 
and when building a team, I would like to ensure that I am naturally the leader or one one navigating the team to success.
