Our team demonstrated an excellent connection, showed great communication and effective team player skills. The feedback from assignment 2 and our experience working as a group in assignment 2 helped us understand our areas of strengths and the areas where we lacked. 
We utilised our time for assignment 3 and 4 to improve ourselves and bring the best out of all. We started our planning as soon as we submitted assignment 2, so we had a lot of time to improve. We had organised more meetings this time compared to our last group work. I really enjoyed the meetings in the teams as it was funfilled like always. 
Besides, the team members' contributions were tremendous. It was easier to understand the assignment task clearly as we discussed the requirements together. Giving and receiving feedback from the team members on each other's work gave me confidence and motivation to complete the task.
<br>Overall, our group 'Tech heads' performed well by showing flexibility, openness, honesty, enthusiasm, and dedication. I must say that this experience has improved my collaboration, communication and teamwork skill along with new technical skills.

Overall, the team was just fantastic. Everyone really worked well together. People made time for the meetings and they were very attentive and they did the work they said.
It was surprising how comfortable everyone was after the first meeting where we had a good ice breaker and people were not scared to say where they felt insecure (with certian technologies etc). and this was great as we were able to focus on what needed to be done
and we could allocate tasks out well.
The one thing i think that could be improved if were able to have more collaboration sessions where we did the work during the meetings instead of talking. That would have knocked out alot of the work quickly.
The one thing I've learnt about groups is that when you work hard initially to build rapport and come together and share common stories (not work related) you manage to work better as a team becuase people feel more comfortable. This was deifnatley the way
in our team and we had great dynamic.
<br>
I dont think the Github activity reflects the effort at all. Becuase some of us didn't feel comfortable with github and with HTML, we shared the load and focused on working on peoples strengths. Some of the team were better and quicker at HTML and took the load and others worked offline
and uploaded to google drive. This was great for our team.

I believe my team worked very well together. The communication was great, group members were well mannered, supportive and well informed. It’s hard to say what could be improved because this is everyone’s first time working together. If I had to choose something I would probably choose to work together on tasks more often as a live exchange of information and ideas should be one of the fastest ways to communicate and complete work together. This is my first university group project I’ve done and I was surprised by how seamless the group worked together. 10/10 would group with again. I think one thing I’ve learned at least about this group is they can be trusted to get the work done, there were no slackers here, everyone put in the effort. I don’t think the github activity accurately reflects the group’s work on this assignment as it doesn’t cover many of the other areas that group members worked on and there were also times when multiple team members might have worked on an individual idea but it was only pushed onto the website by one person.

The team worked amazingly together and everyone was so welcoming and understanding. The teamwork that was involved was absolutely outstanding and couldn’t have asked for a better group of people to do assignment 2 with. Everyone put their 100% in and that is what you want from a team. I always looked forward to our meetings because it was a chance for us to come together and discuss our roles within the assignment and then once we had completed that, we discussed other topics outside of the assignment from our personal lives.
I definitely think that we could have had more meetings, which could have been an improvement, only because every meeting that we had, we got to know more about each other and by the second meeting I felt comfortable enough to provide the feedback and marks that I received from assignment 1.
One thing that surprised me was how GitHub actually works. I have never used GitHub before this subject and now that I have an idea about it, it has really become a game changer for me. I think there was more effort put in away from GitHub.
One thing that I have learnt from working in a group is to always express your strengths and weaknesses, because there will always be a task that will best suit you and that will help the rest of the team.
