<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<div class="body">
My ideal job is to become CTO (Chief Technology officer) of a medium to large organisation.  I've been working to wards this for quite some time and this would be my ideal goal to achieve.
This is a role I will need to work up to, first becoming head of technology and then stepping into the CTO role when it becomes available. <br>
An example of the role is located here  <a href=" https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2803413286/?refId=636df4d5-9437-4d89-bd19-942c6479dfbf">on Linked In</a><br> <br>

<br><br>

<b>Description of the position</b><br>
I like this role as its a very senior role leading a lot of people in an organisation. I have spent many years working for many CTO's, some of which have been amazing, others not so. I feel like I have all the skills and persona to fulfill a role like this 
and I love helping to shape an organisation in a technical pathway. 
The role, as I see it, is to oversee all of the Technology decisions and govern the pathway for an organisation using all of the technical resources in its arsenal. People leadership is also a large part of the role, in which I have always enjoyed managing people and helping to improve people's professional 
portfolios. 
<br><br>
<b>Description of the qualifications and experience</b><br>
For this role I will need to definitely complete my IT degree. I also need some experience in a similar role, I don't think that working as a CTO is required, rather, a senior role similar to it would do (such as head of technology). 
I need a barrage of other technical experience in the IT field, managing large programs, managing people and managing budgets. In addition to this, communication skills and dealing with vendors/clients. 
<br><br>
<b>Description of the qualifications I already have</b><br>
I have a vast experience in working on large programs, up to aud $300M programs of work, and managing large teams of up to 20 resources. I have good budgeting and forecasting skills and plenty of solid technical experience that I have gained throughout the years. 
I have excellent people management skills and have excellent communication and interpersonal skills. 
<br><br>
<b>Description of the qualifications I need</b><br>
I currently need to step into a head of technology role that will provide me with the stepping stone to lead much larger teams and have a lot more seniority. I am currently 2-3 years away from this position and an additional 2-3 years from CTO. 
In addition to this, I will need to complete my Degree as no CTO role is available without an IT degree. Other than these two qualifications, all of the CTO roles advertised have skills that I have already obtained in my career. 
<br><br>
<b>Plan on how to reach these goals</b><br>
The plan I have consists of the following 
<ul>
  <li>Move to a "Head Of" role. This role is something I am looking for at the moment, and will most likely be able to find something suitable in a large organisation soon. Once I find this role, I will spend approx 2-3 years in this role honing my skills, reporting directly to the CTO. </li>
  <li>Finish my IT degree. This will most likely occur in the next 2 years, which would be in line of when I am ready to step into a CTO role from my Head Of role. </li>
  <li>Manage large teams, this is something I am already doing, but would like to manage much larger teams</li>
</ul>
Once I have taken these steps, I can then move into a CTO role which would be a dream job for me and my career.
